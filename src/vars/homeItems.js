var myDetails = 'Hello, I am Fayaz Bin Salam. I love Programming, making application/software for Mobile, Web and Desktop. For me, A Computer or A Mobile phone is nothing but some plastics and metals. But when it understands my language, it feels like a miracle!\nI started programming as a hobby since 2009. Wrote my first few scripts in Batch and VBScript. Later I learned C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript etc, Worked in so many libraries & frameworks like ReactJS(one of my favorites), Angular2+, NodeJS, worked using so many technologies like Git, Arduino, etc. It does feel amazing to see myself improving. Hope to improve everything around me one day...'
